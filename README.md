This project deals with housing price prediction using `Multiplr Linear Regression`
Our job is to get the betas for each feature in the datset and use their linear combination to predict the housing price.

Housing dataset consists of some 500 houses with their prices listed in price column.
Each house has several features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
Using these features we have to get a linear regression line to predict the prices.

The project repository is divide into sub directories:
1. data: data consists of the raw housing data and clened housing data.
2. models: models have pickle files of the model that have been saved during model training.
3. notebooks: This has one .ipynb file written in jupyter notebook.
4. reports: It has all the plots and graphical analysis done in th project.
5. src: It has all the source code saved as .py files
6. environment.yml is the package list of the environment I have worked on. Use this to create your own environment to ensure the code does not break.
7. .gitignore do not edit this file.

HOW TO USE:
1. Run the .ipynb file in the notebooks directory but ensure the path to be set to the path in which your data is stored.
2. You can also run .py file in the python interpreter by importing the file you need.

The final model is saved as MODEL 4.pkl file in the model dir.


The final analysis suggest that MLR is one way to solve the problem with an adjusted R2 @ `0.6257` and mse @ `0.0146` on the test data set.
